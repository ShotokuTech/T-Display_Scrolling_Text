# T-Display_Scrolling_Text
TTGO T-Display Scrolling Text.
Answering this question about scrolling text on the TTGO T-Display has been on my list for too long. With a little time off for the holidays I have some time to look at this. I BING searched for a while but came up empty. So I went to the examples in the TFT_eSPI library I loaded in my previous TTGO T-Display video. I work throught serveral iterations, reverse engineering and tweeking the Sprite_scroll example. Finally, I mix in three lines from FactoryTest to display a background image.
